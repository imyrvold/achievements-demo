# achievements-demo
The demo app Achievements uses interactive notifications to interact with the user.
When the app launches, a short demo description tells the user what to do.
When the user quits the demo, an interactive notifications pops up, 
and the user have to drag on the top handle to reveal two buttons.
If the user chooses to make an achievement goal for today, he will click
on the goal button, and this launches the app again to give him a chance to type a goal.
When he quits again, the second notification pops up, and he will have a chance to give 
todays goal result.
